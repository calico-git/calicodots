```
sudo pacman -S git
git clone https://github.com/calico-git/calicodots
cd calicodots
chmod u+x install.sh
./install.sh
```

if you want to you can avoid entering your pswd so much by running it under root so

```
su
pacman -S git
git clone https://github.com/calico-git/calicodots

chmod u+x install.sh
./install.sh
```
always clone the repo in your home dir (~/)
